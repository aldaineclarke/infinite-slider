# infinite-slider
Second project in the challenge..
Uses the translate property to move the slider
Creates a new node for the first element of the slider and the last element then append them to the slider.
The clone for the first node is prepended to the end of the slider while the clone for the last node is appended to the start
once the slider position is at the position of the first clone then it removes the transition and resets the position of the slider
then it adds the transition and begins again appearing as a circle of items.
